Scenario: API_US_11_TC_01 When a valid GET request is sent to the 'api/categories/list' endpoint with the appropriate
authorization credentials, it should return a status code of 200, and the response remark should be "success"

* The API user sets "api/categories/list" path parameters
* The API user saves the response from the api categories list endpoint with valid authorization information
    #Api kullanicisi api categories list endpointinden donen responsei gecerli authorization bilgisi ile kaydeder
